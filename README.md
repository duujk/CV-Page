# CV-Page
This project was created for a potential employer to showcase my skills in software development and the knowledge of REST web services. 
Assignment description:

The purpose of this assignment is to get an understanding of how you will approach a task and show some skill related to the position.

Use your creativity in the solution, try to demonstrate skill related to the job and have some FUN ðŸ˜Š

Please also consider error handling and UX in your solution.

The task is to make a webpage with two sections:

First section must show your CV (limited to 1 page). It is for you to decide how it should look.
Second section must contain some input fields and an action button. The action button must request a public REST API, that returns JSON data, with the input entered in the input fields as parameters to the REST service and show the response in a nice formatted way.  Example of a public REST Service that returns JSON: https://qrng.anu.edu.au/API/api-demo.php . Feel free to use any REST service as long as the response is in JSON format. You can build your own REST API if you like.
